## Description
 This project showcases a text editor that runs in the browser. This app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

## Installation
To install the application, navigate to website: https://pwa-text-editor-challenge-g6a3.onrender.com and click on the `install` button on top left of the page.

## Usage
To use the application, simply type any character on the text editor screen. Typed characters should persist even when the page is reloaded.
